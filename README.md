# Stockle - a Wordle clone with Stocks

### [Play now](https://stockle.win)

Forked from [hannahcode/wordle](https://github.com/hannahcode/wordle).

It accepts any 4-letter stock symbol from NYSE/Nasdaq or B3 as input. The daily guessing dataset is composed of some of
most traded stocks (by volume) in the last few days before the game release (Jan 26, 2022).

The "ticker of the day" changes every day at the market opening (9:30am EST for NYSE/Nasdaq or 9:30am BRT for B3).

### TODO
